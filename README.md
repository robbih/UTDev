UT Development Analyst Project

This sample project is an analysis of "University Advancement, Donations, and Giving" from the Tableau Public Sample Data https://public.tableau.com/app/resources/sample-data Per Tableau, "A table of donations made to Universities in the United States. The donation amounts and locations in this data set are fictitious and intended for training purposes only."

The dataset was originally in an xls file with 2 sheets. The original dataset was imported into Tableau and each sheet was exported as a csv file (attached in this repository) for analysis using matplotlib
